## What is dSIPRouter?

dSIPRouter allows you to quickly turn [Kamailio](https://www.kamailio.org/) into an easy to use SIP Service Provider platform, which enables three basic use cases:

- **SIP Trunking services:**
Provide services to customers that have an on-premise PBX such as FreePBX, FusionPBX, Avaya, etc.
We have support for IP and credential based authentication.

- **Hosted PBX services:**
Proxy SIP Endpoint requests to a multi-tenant PBX such as FusionPBX or single-tenant such as FreePBX.
We have an integration with FusionPBX that make this really easy and scalable!

- **Microsoft Teams Direct Routing:**
We can provide SBC functionality that allows dSIPRouter to interconnect your existing voice infrastructure or VoIP carrier to your Microsoft Teams environment.

The dSIPRouter UI allows you to manage the platform.  We also make it easy to intergrate dSIPRouter into your existing workflow by using our [API](https://www.postman.com/dopensource/workspace/dsiprouter/overview)
