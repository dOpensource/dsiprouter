==========================================
FreePBX Hosting - Pass Thru Authentication
==========================================

Here we will demostrate how to setup dSIPRouter to enable hosting FreePBX using Pass Thru Authentication. FreePBX is designed to be a single tenant system or in other words, it was built to handle one SIP Domain.  So, we use dSIPRouter to define a SIP Domain and we pass thru Registration info to the FreePBX server so that you don't have to change how authentication is done.  However, this will only work for one FreePBX server.  If you have a cluster of FreePBX servers then use "Local Subscriber Table" authentication.  The value of having dSIPRouter in front of FreePBX is to provide you with flexibility.  After setting this up you will have the ability upgrade or migrate users from one FreePBX instance to another without having to take an outage.  The following video shows how to configure this.  The steps to implement this is below the video.

Microsoft Teams Direct Routing (SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED)
======================================================

dSIPRouter can act as an intermediary Session Border Controller between Microsoft Teams Direct Routing and your SIP provider or SIP servers.

An instance of dSIPRouter can either be a single tenant configuration (like sbc.example.com) or multi-tenant under a single wildcard subdomain (like *.sbc.example.com where * is the tenant's name).

.. image:: images/direct-routing-sbcs.png
          :align: center


------------------
Steps to Implement
------------------

1. `Buy a license <https://dopensource.com/dsiprouter-annual-subscriptions/>`_  and follow the license installation instructions that are emailed to you.

2. Add any carriers you need for inbound and outbound routing, define appropriate routes.

3. Authorize your SBC's domain with Microsoft 365 by adding a TXT record starting with ms= per `Microsoft's documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-domain?view=o365-worldwide>`_.
Note: For multi-tenant use, authorizing the root subdomain or domain (if you use *.sbc.example.com, you would authorize sbc.example.com) should avoid the need to authorize each subdomain below this (like clientname.example.com)

4. Create a global admin user with proper Teams licensing associated with the domain (or for multi-tenant both the root subdomain (eg: sbc.example.com) and client's domain (eg: client.sbc.example.com))

5. Add the Teams session border controller in `Teams Admin Center <https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/direct-routing/v2>`_. Ensure the SIP port is correct (usually 5061) and the SBC is enabled!

6. `Install PowerShell <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux>`_ type pwsh then:

.. code-block:: bash

	Install-Module -Name MicrosoftTeams
	Import-Module MicrosoftTeams
	$userCredential = Get-Credential
	Connect-MicrosoftTeams -Credential $userCredential

  

Login Note: If your using multi-factor authentication (MFA/2FA), log in by typing Connect-MicrosoftTeams

Debian 10 Note: 
	If you run into `this OpenSSL issue <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/12202>`_ , here is `a workaround <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/12202#issuecomment-720402212>`_!
	**Replace sbc.example.com, user@example.com and +13137175555** with your SBC's FQDN, the user's email address and their phone number (with + then country code, use +1 if you are in the North American Numbering Plan)

.. code-block:: bash

	Set-CsOnlinePstnUsage -Identity Global -Usage @{Add="US and Canada"}
	Set-CsOnlineVoiceRoute -Identity "LocalRoute" -NumberPattern ".*" -OnlinePstnGatewayList sbc.example.com
	New-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy "US Only" -OnlinePstnUsages "US and Canada"

	# This is suppose to stop MSTeams from using the Microsoft Dialing Plan and using the routing policies that was defined above
	Set-CsTenantHybridConfiguration -UseOnPremDialPlan $False

	# Apply and the US Only Voice Routing Policy to the user
	Grant-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity “user@example.com“ -PolicyName "US Only"

	# If it doesn’t return a value of US Only, then wait 15 minutes and try it again.  It sometime takes a while for the policy to be ready.
	Get-CsOnlineUser “user@example.com" | select OnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy

	# Define a outgoing phone number (aka DID) and set Enterprise Voice and Voicemail
	Set-CsUser -Identity "user@example.com" -OnPremLineURI tel:+13137175555 -EnterpriseVoiceEnabled $true -HostedVoiceMail $true


Note: Log out by typing Disconnect-MicrosoftTeams

Credits to Mack at dSIPRouter for the SkypeForBusiness script and `this blog post <https://seanmcavinue.net/2021/04/20/configure-teams-direct-routing-simple-deployment-via-powershell/>`_ for helping me update these commands for the new MicrosoftTeams PowerShell module.

-----------------------
Add a single Teams User
-----------------------
If you have an existing dSIPRouter SBC configured in Teams and have added a DID as an inbound route already, then run the commands below in PowerShell to add an additional user.

**Replace user@example.com and +13137175555** with your SBC's FQDN, the user's email address and their phone number (with + then country code, use +1 if you are in the North American Numbering Plan)

.. code-block:: bash

	# Get Credentials, if using MFA/2FA just run Connect-MicrosoftTeams
	$userCredential = Get-Credential
	Connect-MicrosoftTeams -Credential $userCredential

	# Apply and the US Only Voice Routing Policy to the user
	Grant-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity “user@example.com“ -PolicyName "US Only"

	# Define a outgoing phone number (aka DID) and set Enterprise Voice and Voicemail
	Set-CsUser -Identity "user@example.com" -OnPremLineURI tel:+13137175555 -EnterpriseVoiceEnabled $true -HostedVoiceMail $true

   
Note: Log out by typing Disconnect-MicrosoftTeams


=============================================
Configure STIR/SHAKEN (SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED)
=============================================
dSIPRouter enables an organization to start signing calls by enabling the STIR/SHAKEN module.  This module will sign outbound calls and validate that inbound calls are signed.  It also have the ability to add a prefix to the callerid if calls have an attestion of an A, B or C.  You can also specify a callerid prefix if callers aren't validated.  Lastly, you have the option to block invalidated callers. 

1. Login to dSIPRouter
2. Purchase a license from the `dSIPRouter Marketplace <https://dopensource.com/product-category/dsiprouter/>`_
3. Click System Settings -> License Manager
4. Add the license to the system

5. If testing, connect to your dSIPRouter instance using ssh, run the command below and enter the requested information to create a self-signed certificate

.. code-block:: bash
	
	/opt/dsiprouter/resources/stirshaken/generate_self_signed_cert.sh
	
If not testing, obtain a valid STIR/SHAKEN certificate and place them in the /etc/dsiprouter/certs/stirshaken/ directory.  For the purpose of these instructions, please name the certificate sp-cert.pem and name the key sp-key.pem  

6. Check that the certificate can be accessed via https.  Open a web browser and enter the following into the URL.  This will be used by other VoIP servers to validate the signature of the the call.  

.. code-block:: bash

	https://<replace with ip or hostname>:5000/stirshaken_certs/sp-cert.pem

7. Click System Settings -> STIR/SHAKEN
8. Slide the Disabled toggle to Enabled
9. Enter the Certificate URL from Step 6
10. Enter the Key Path, which by default will be 

.. code-block:: bash
	
	/etc/dsiprouter/certs/stirshaken/sp-key.pem

11. Click Save

The STIR/SHAKEN page should look like this:
