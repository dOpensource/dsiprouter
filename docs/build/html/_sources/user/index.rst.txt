Intro to dSIPRouter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



dSIPRouter allows you to quickly turn `Kamailio <http://www.kamailio.org/>`_ into an easy to use SIP Service Provider platform, which enables the following two basic use cases: 
       
       
- **SIP Trunking services:** Provide services to customers that have an on-premise PBX such as FreePBX, FusionPBX, Avaya, etc.  We have support for IP and credential based authentication.

- **Hosted PBX services:** Proxy SIP Endpoint requests to a multi-tenant PBX such as FusionPBX or single-tenant such as FreePBX. We have an integration with FusionPBX that make is really easy and scalable!

- **Microsoft Teams Direct Routing:** We can provide SBC functionality that allows dSIPRouter to interconnect your existing voice infrastructure or VoIP carrier to your Microsoft Teams environment.
