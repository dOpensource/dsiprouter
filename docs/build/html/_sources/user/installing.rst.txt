Kamailio will be automatically installed along with dSIPRouter.
Must be installed on a fresh install of one of the supported operating systems.
You will not be prompted for any information.  It will take anywhere from  9-12 minutes to install - depending on the processing power of the machine. You can secure the Kamailio database after the installation.

We maintain installation documentation for the following operating systems.  Please open a pull request if you want to add and maintain addtional documentation:

Amazon AMI's
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now provide Amazon AMI's (pre-built images) which allows you to get up and going even faster.
You can find a list of the images `here <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&y=0&searchTerms=dsiprouter/>`_.
The images are a nominal fee, which goes toward supporting the project.
