We maintain installation documentation for the following operating systems.  Please open a pull request if you want to add and maintain addtional documentation:

- :ref:`debian_install`
- :ref:`rhel_install`

Install times vary by depending on OS and system hardware.
On debian/centos, expect a short install time, typically around 12 minutes.
On amazon linux, expect long compilation times, typically around 45 minutes.

dSIPRouter should be installed on a clean install of the OS.
To upgrade your dSIPRouter platform, see instead :ref:`upgrading`

Prerequisites:
--------------

- Must run this as the root user (you can use sudo)
- git needs to be installed
- Hostname needs to be set to a FQDN (for certbot to get LetsEncrypt certificate)
- The installer will handle all other dependencies

Install Options
----------------

- Proxy SIP Traffic Only (Don't Proxy audio (RTP) traffic)
- Proxy SIP Traffic, Audio and it configures the system to work properly when the PBX's and dSIPRouter are behind a NAT.

Amazon AMI's
