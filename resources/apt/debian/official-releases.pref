## default priory assignments
# priority 1
# versions coming from archives which in their Release files are marked as "NotAutomatic: yes",
# but not as "ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes" like the Debian experimental archive.
#
# priority 100
# a version that is already installed (if any) and to the versions coming from archives which,
# in their Release files are marked as "NotAutomatic: yes" and "ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes",
# like the Debian backports archive since squeeze-backports.
#
# priority 500
# versions that do not belong to the target release.
#
# priority 990
# versions that belong to the target release.
#
## interpretation of priority (P)
# P >= 1000
# causes a version to be installed even if this constitutes a downgrade of the package
#
# 990 <= P < 1000
# causes a version to be installed even if it does not come from the target release, unless the installed version is more recent
#
# 500 <= P < 990
# causes a version to be installed unless there is a version available belonging to the target release or the installed version is more recent
#
# 100 <= P < 500
# causes a version to be installed unless there is a version available belonging to some other distribution or the installed version is more recent
#
# 0 < P < 100
# causes a version to be installed only if there is no installed version of the package
#
# P < 0
# prevents the version from being installed
#
# P = 0
# has undefined behaviour (do not use it)
