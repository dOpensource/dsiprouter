## Installing dSIPRouter Using Terraform on Digital Ocean

1. Generate an SSH key if you don't already have one

2. Configure the SSH key into your Digital Ocean Account

3. Obtain a Digital Ocean API key and store the key as an environment variable

```
export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=...
```

4. Copy terraform.tfvars.sample to terraform.tfvars

```
cp  terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars
```
5. Modify terraform.tfvars so that it overrides your variables, which is located in variables.tf.  The pvt_key_path is the location of your private key.  The pub_key_name is the name of the public key you defined when you uploaded your SSH key.  The dsiprouter_prefix is the prefix that will be concatenated to the name of the droplet that will be created.  The number_of_environments is used to specify how many instances will be crated.

```
pvt_key_path="/Users/mackhendricks/.ssh/dopensource-training"
dsiprouter_prefix="dev"
number_of_environments=1
pub_key_name="dopensource-training"
```

All of the variables and any default values can be found in variables.tf.  

6. Create a new instance of dSIPRouter

The following command will create a new instance of dSIPRouter based on the master branch.  The OS image will be Debian 12 and the dsiprouter_prefix will be overriden by demo.


```
terraform apply -var dsip_ver=master -var dsiprouter_prefix=demo -var image=debian-12-x64
```

If you want to create a demo instance of dSIPRouter in your Digitalocean environment with a DNS record use this.  Note, you will need to change the dns_demo_domain variable to a domain that you have hosted with DigitalOcean.

```
terraform apply -var dsip_ver=master -var image=debian-12-x64 -var dsiprouter_prefix=demo -var additional_commands='dsiprouter setcredentials -dc admin:ZmIwMTdmY2I5NjE4' -var dns_demo_enabled=1 -var dns_demo_domain=dsiprouter.org -var dns_demo_hostname=demo
```

7. Destroy your instance if you are done with it by using the terraform destory command

```
terraform destroy
```
