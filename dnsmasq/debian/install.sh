# dSIPRouter DNS Resolution - How it Works
#
# Many of the cluster features require a multiple IP addresses to be associated with a local hostname.
# To make these checks performant and not rely on external DNS, a local stub resolver supporting
# multiple IPs per host is required (dnsmasq). This is equivalent to having multiple A / AAAA records
# on an external DNS server. The difference here is that the entries are read locally from /etc/hosts.
# A hostname is first checked locally, and before trying to resolve via the external DNS servers.
#
# By default DNS resolution via other applications is bypassed. DNSMasq is therefore the primary DNS
# resolver for the entire system (even for glibc).
# Upstream DNS resolvers (external, other stub resolvers, etc..) are attempted only after the DNSMasq
# stub resolver checks local records from /etc/hosts.

# dSIPRouter Network Configuration - How it Works
#
# To support a variety of deployment environments the network stack is strictly configured on install.
# The goal is to make builds as reproducible as possible in any environment, without concern for the
# OS provider's (downstream, VM image, etc..) chosen network stack.
# Therefore, to customize your network configuration, make sure your network configurations operate on
# the supported network applications outlined here.
#
# Here is a summary of how the installed network stack works on debian-based OS:
# 1. ignore cloud-init network configurations
# 2. try configuring the network via network-manager
# 3. try configuring the network via systemd-networkd
# 4. try configuring the network via ifupdown
#
# By default network-manager / systemd-networkd will try to assign IPs based on DHCP.
# By default ifupdown is left unaltered.

# TODO: Currently this is implemented with systemd service drop-ins but this is very hacky and does not allow
#       fine grain control over timing and service status / network availability checks throughout the startup
#       ordering chain.
#       The preferred method we will implement in the future, will be using network-manager to load the rest of
#       the possible network management services.
#       I.E. instead of trying network-manager then waiting for it to timeout and trying systemd-networkd, the
#       network manager would try each plugin (plugins=keyfile,networkd,ifupdown) in order, until one is successful.
#       The network manager project currently only supports keyfile.ifupdown above. networkd support needs implemented.
#       Other plugins can be used as an example for the new implementation:
#       https://github.com/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/tree/main/src/core/settings/plugins
